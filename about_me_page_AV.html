                                    When I was younger I used to hate talking about the enviorment. The talks were always over the top, boring and depressing. They were so depressing that by the time I made it into middle school, I had accepted that there was nothing that could be done and all attempts were futile. I kept this outlook until 6th grade where I learnt that  its not possible to slove the cimate crisis alone, but that working together as a community to save the planet is possible. In the future, I want to persue a career in enviormental engineering. I want a job thats related to enviormental science that also envolves computer science.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                I am very outgoing and I work well in teams. When I am passionate about a goal I will work hard to achive it. I am always eager to help others and I am able to keep calm even under pressure. Lastly I am creative and ambious which helps me make new ideas come to life.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                I have been in speech and debate classes for the past 3 years which provided me important team buliding skills. It has also caused me to be very reaserch orientated and to question everything. I was a honor roll student throughout middle school which taught me the value of hard work and helped me create a good work ethic.
                                </p>

                                In conclusion, I am ambious and motivated to achive my goals. I want to create solutions and I am always eager to help others! Thank you for reading my about me page, if you are intrested in more of my work feel free to explore the rest of my page!
